Welcome to A I Fact Checking and Verification.

I'm Amanda, the Chief Learning Officer at writingIO. This mini course teaches one of the most critical A I skills: verifying what A I tells you.

This video and all videos in this course were created with an A I tool, allowing us to keep content current.

Here's something important to understand. A I can be confidently wrong. It can present false information as fact, cite sources that don't exist, and make up statistics that sound plausible.

This isn't occasional. It's common. If you use A I without verification, you will eventually share or act on false information.

The good news is that verification isn't hard. It just requires knowing what to check and building good habits.

In this mini course, you'll learn how A I makes mistakes, techniques for verifying claims and statistics, how to check sources and citations, and habits that protect you from A I errors.

These skills will save you from embarrassment and bad decisions. They'll also make you a more critical thinker in general.

Let's learn to trust but verify.
