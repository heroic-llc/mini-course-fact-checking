A I citations are particularly unreliable. Here's how to check them.

For academic papers, search the exact title in Google Scholar, PubMed, or relevant databases. Check that the authors match. Verify the publication exists. If you can't find it, it probably doesn't exist.

For books, search library catalogs and booksellers. Verify author, title, and publication details. A I invents books that sound real but aren't.

For news articles, search the publication's website directly. Try the exact headline if A I provided one. Check dates and authors.

For quotes, be especially skeptical. A I frequently misattributes or fabricates quotes. Search for the exact quote in quotation marks. Check multiple sources for attribution.

For websites, try to access the actual URL. Many A I-cited pages don't exist or say something different than claimed.

When a citation is wrong, the underlying information might still be true. Search for the actual information from other sources. But if you can't verify it anywhere, don't use it.

Build source checking into your workflow. Don't save it for the end. Checking as you go prevents building on false foundations.

A quick verification habit saves significant problems later.
