Let me share habits that make verification automatic.

Adopt a trust but verify mindset. Treat A I like a helpful but unreliable colleague. Appreciate its assistance while checking important claims.

Verify before sharing. Before you put anything from A I into a document, email, or presentation, verify key facts. The few minutes spent checking saves potential embarrassment.

Flag uncertain items as you work. When A I tells you something that needs verification, note it immediately. Don't assume you'll remember to check later.

Use verification prompts. Ask A I directly: What's your confidence level on this? What's the source? Are there counterarguments? Sometimes this reveals uncertainty.

Cross reference across sources. Don't rely on A I alone for verification. Check claims against independent external sources.

Be extra careful in high stakes situations. Job applications, client work, published content, important decisions. These deserve thorough verification.

Keep learning. As you encounter A I mistakes, notice patterns. What kinds of claims tend to be wrong? This builds your intuition for what needs checking.

Verification isn't about distrusting A I. It's about using A I responsibly. The combination of A I assistance with human verification is more powerful than either alone.

You now have the skills to fact check A I effectively. Use them consistently, and you'll avoid the mistakes that catch many A I users.
