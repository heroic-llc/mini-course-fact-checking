Let's get practical about verifying claims.

Focus on what matters. You can't verify everything. Prioritize claims that are central to your work, claims you'll share with others, claims that seem surprising, and statistics or specific facts.

Use multiple sources. One source isn't enough. Check claims against multiple independent, reliable sources. If several sources agree, confidence increases.

Go to primary sources. A I might cite an article that cites a study. Find the original study. Secondary sources can distort information, and A I can distort it further.

Verify statistics carefully. Check that the statistic exists. Confirm the source. Check the date. Understand the context. Statistics are easily fabricated and easily misleading.

Ask A I about its sources. When A I makes a claim, ask where it comes from. What's the source for that? Can you provide a citation? Sometimes A I will admit uncertainty when pressed.

Use fact checking resources. Snopes, PolitiFact, and similar sites address common claims. Government databases provide authoritative statistics. Academic databases verify research claims.

When you can't verify something, note the uncertainty. Say sources suggest or according to some analyses rather than presenting unverified claims as established facts.

Verification takes time but prevents costly mistakes.
